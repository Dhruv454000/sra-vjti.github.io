# What was your internship about, and what was the duration of it ?

e-Yantra is a robotics outreach program funded by the Ministry of Education and hosted at IIT Bombay. They have different competitions such as the e-Yantra Robotics Competition, e-Yantra Innovation Challenge, etc. I was a Summer Intern at the e-Yantra Lab, IIT Bombay working on a Robotics Project for a period of about 7 weeks. Projects at eYantra Lab include a variety of domains including Robotics, Control Systems, Embedded Systems, FPGA’s, Web Dev, AI/ML, Computer Vision, etc.

# How do you approach the Organization/University ?

Interns are usually selected through either the e-Yantra Robotics Competition or e-Yantra Innovation Challenge. If you perform well in these competitions, you will be given the opportunity to appear for the group interview followed by the individual interview round.

# What was your project about ?

The aim of my project, “Prota: The ROS Bot” was to build an efficient and modular CAD design of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle(UGV) from scratch and then build it in hardware. Following that, we had to implement Simultaneous Localization and Mapping(SLAM) on the hardware bot as well as in simulation.

# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?

The campus experience at IIT Bombay was amazing. The facilities related to our work such as a good working space, required hardware for our project, etc were provided to us. Even the other on-campus facilities were great. Also, we had to team up with people from all over the country which was a great learning experience for all of us.

# How much was your stipend ?

Confidential.

# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?

The project is not currently open sourced. If ever it becomes open sourced that I will put up a link here.

# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.

Perform well in the e-Yantra Robotics Competition and give the interviews confidently. Also research about the projects you have listed in your preferences.
