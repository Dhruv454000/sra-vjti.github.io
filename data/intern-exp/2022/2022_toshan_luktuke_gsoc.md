# What was your internship about, and what was the duration of it ?

Google Summer of Code is an international, annual program in which Google awards stipends to students who successfully complete a free and open-source software coding project during the summer. I was working with JdeRobot, which is an open source organisation that develops various tools to help proliferate education in Robotics.


# How do you approach the Organization/University ?

My organisation had some tasks we had to finish before we could email the project mentors. Once I finished the preliminary tasks I emailed my mentors regarding my interest in the project. The mentors then gave me some more tasks related to the project, on completion we discussed about my proposal and their expectations from the project.


# What was your project about ?

Improvement of Visual Circuit. Visual Circuit is a tool that aims to make robotics applications simpler for beginners to develop by providing them with GUI where they can drag-and-drop blocks to build even complicated applications.

# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?

GSoC is remote.

# How much was your stipend ?

$1500 in 2 evaluations of 45% (week 6) and 55% (week 12) payment

# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?

Yep, Iâ€™ve written a blog on the development [here](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/gsoc2022-Toshan_Luktuke) and you can check out the Github repo itself [here](https://github.com/JdeRobot/VisualCircuit). In addition you can use the tool yourself at [visualcircuit.org](https://visualcircuit.org/)


# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.

Scout out which organisations you want to apply to in December itself and start contributing to them early. Once the projects are announced by the organization, contact the relevant mentors to get more details about your project. Remember to get your proposal reviewed by your mentors before submission.


# What is the best way to contact you ?
