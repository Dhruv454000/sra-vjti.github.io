# What was your internship about, and what was the duration of it ?

Google Summer of Code is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors. I was working with Gnuastro which is a part of the umbrella organization openastronomy.


# How do you approach the Organization/University ?

GSoC is an open source student program where students from all over the world participate by submitting proposals for projects they are interested in. Every org participating in GSoC will have an ideas page with many prospect ideas, also some unfinished ideas(or ideas requiring enhancement) from previous GSoC. Some orgs have you commit some code by creating a Pull Request(PR), some have you solve tasks, some may have no necessary criteria except for a proposal. The aspect common to all orgs/mentors is showing your enthusiasm for the project, and to learn. Also having a few(or even one in my case) commits to the org before submitting the proposal will go a long way.


# What was your project about ?

My project was to create a Gnuastro Python package using Extension modules to enable use of the Gnuastro Library in Python.

# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?

GSoC is remote. However, my organization, Gnuastro, was really good. My mentor(who was also the maintainer of the org) Mohammad Akhlaghi was one of the best project leads Iâ€™ve seen. The environment and community of other developers were also very supportive and open and there were never any hard deadlines imposed upon me.


# How much was your stipend ?

$3000 in 2 evaluations of 45% (week 6) and 55% (week 12) payment

# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?

# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.

Scout out which organisations you want to apply to in December itself and start contributing to them early. Once the projects are announced by the organization, contact the relevant mentors to get more details about your project. Remember to get your proposal reviewed by your mentors before submission.
