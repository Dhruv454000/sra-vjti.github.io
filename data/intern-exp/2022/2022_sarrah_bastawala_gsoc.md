# What was your internship about, and what was the duration of it ?

Google Summer of Code is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors. I was working with GNU Octave along with 3 other contributors chosen under the same organisation.

# How do you approach the Organization/University ?

GSoC is an open source student program where students from all over the world participate by submitting proposals for projects they are interested in. Every org participating in GSoC will have an ideas page with many prospect ideas, also some unfinished ideas(or ideas requiring enhancement) from previous GSoC. Some orgs have you commit some code by creating a Pull Request(PR), some have you solve tasks, some may have no necessary criteria except for a proposal. The common aspect among all, and especially in my case, was the emphasis to show interest via communicating to the prospective mentors as well as the org on the common IRC (Internet Relay Channel) which might be Discourse, Matrix or Slack depending on the org,as well as a proactive approach to solve existing bugs and a few commits before sending the project proposal.

# What was your project about ?

My project was to add support for Sparse computations in the existing Ode15{i,s} solvers in Octave, using Octave classes and remove the dependency on th KLU library that was previously used.

# How was the host University in terms of research and campus life ?

GSoC is remote. However, my organization was very welcoming and communicative throughout the project, and in spite of everybody participating having different time zones, all meets were well-planned and accommodating. My mentor, Carlo de Falco, was also a professor, and while I got to learn a lot from him, there were some crucial weeks during which he was unreachable, and my advice to anyone else would be to make sure to establish a strong communication channel. With my org having weekly meets with all four GSoC students, the entire environment was very motivating and the support regarding my project, the help of the community and the understanding of my mentors regarding the scope were hugely appreciated.

# How much was your stipend ?

$3000 in 2 evaluations of 45% (week 6) and 55% (week 12) payment

# Can you provide any resources to check out your project ?

# Suggestions to the fellow VJTIians who want to go for this internship.

Scout out which organisations you want to apply to in December itself and start contributing to them early. Once the projects are announced by the organization, contact the relevant mentors as well as the organisation maintainer (mostly done via the IRC on an open forum) to get more details about your project. Remember to get your proposal reviewed by your mentors before submission.
